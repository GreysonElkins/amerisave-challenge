This was completed as a code challenge in an application to work at Amerisave. The app was built with Typescript and Node.js and is designed to created a file for each log that tallies how many times an email appears in the original file. The output is included here.

In order to run this locally: 
* clone down the repo
* `cd` into the repo
* run `npm install`
* run `npm start`

The command line should log `Printed X new logs!` and overwrite any file in the Output directory.
